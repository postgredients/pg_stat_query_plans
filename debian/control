Package: postgresql-11-pgqp-ya
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, postgresql-11
Description: PostgreSQL extension to gather per-query executioon plan statistics.
 Statistics gathered are the same as for original pg_stat_query_plans extension.
 Difference is data stored per normalized execution plan, not query. Normalized
 execution plan is derived from query execution plan after removing all unimportant
 data such as cost and numeric values (quite similar to query normalization in
 original pg_stat_query_plans). Query texts and plans are stored in memory and by
 default packed by pg_lzcompress.
